Here is my openGL PBR demo. Basic UI elements allow the user to select between a textured and non textured demo. Non textured demo allows the modification of RGB, metallic, roughness, and ambient color values. Additionally, four point lights are avaible to experiment with the lighting of the scene.

To use the app simply adjust the sliders to the desired values on the object or light UI windows. To move the camera use WASD controls and hold the RIGHT CLICK to rotate the camera.
